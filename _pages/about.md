<p>I am currently a security guy at the University of Utah supervised by Prof. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/muzhang82" target="_blank">Mu Zhang</a>. Before this, I did research work in Nanjing University and Prof. <a href="http://software.nju.edu.cn/eytang" target="_blank">Enyi Tang</a> is my fantastic adviser. I spent a wonderful summer internship at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign hosted by Prof. <a href="https://tianyin.github.io" target="_blank">Tianyin Xu</a> in 2019. 
      
<p>My research interests include blockchain security, programming languages, numerical analysis using programming language techniques. I want to build tools and systems to guarantee the desired behavior of a system in a reliable and scalable way. Meanwhile, I am interested in disassembling some PC games and modifying some values (e.g. the chance to get awful items) in my free time, which could be funny and somewhat troublesome.</p>

<p>I am currently exploring fascinating smart contract security topics and would be eager to collaborate with researchers who share similar interests. </p>
