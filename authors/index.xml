      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am an undergraduate student major in Software Engineering in Najing University, China. I did research work in Nanjing University and Prof. Enyi Tang is my fantastic adviser. I spent a wonderful summer internship at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign hosted by Prof. Tianyin Xu in 2019. I was also a visiting student at Purdue University hosted by Prof. Xiangyu Zhang in Sepetember, 2019. Later I had a short experience at University of California, Santa Barbara.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My research interests include programming languages, program analysis and security. I want to build reliable tools and systems to guarantee the desired behavior of a system in a reliable and scalable way. I&amp;rsquo;m actively seeking for a PhD positon in PL and Security.&lt;/p&gt;
